# SQL-mgm

Finally figured out both the update and delete functions using the builtins.
Turns out you have to assingn them to variables because they return ints with how many things got updated.

I also tried it with raw queries but those didn't work. Thankfully I don't need them.

I did change item into a data class (which those are actually very handy)
